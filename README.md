# Scrap_autoreflex

This is a web scraping project that a french startup gave me as a practical exercise. This startup gathers 
car offers that are collected on the internet. Then its website condenses a very large number of advertisements.

This projects aims at scraping all the features of all the offers that can be found on www.autoreflex.com
